# üî• Challenges & Solutions

This section covers the key challenges faced during the development of the **Crypto Price Tracker** and the solutions implemented to overcome them.

---

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ API Rate Limits**
### üî¥ **Problem**
- The CoinGecko API has **rate limits**, restricting the number of API requests per minute.
- If too many requests are made, the API **blocks further requests** temporarily.

### ‚úÖ **Solution**
- Implemented **query caching** using **React Query** to reduce redundant API calls.
- **Disabled auto-fetching on window focus** (`refetchOnWindowFocus: false`).
- Cached data for **1 minute (`staleTime: 60000`)** to prevent frequent API requests.

```tsx
const { data, error, isLoading, refetch } = useQuery<CryptoData, Error>({
  queryKey: ["cryptoPrices"],
  queryFn: fetchCryptoPrices,
  refetchOnWindowFocus: false,
  staleTime: 60000, // Cache for 1 min
});
